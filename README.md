# ✨ Siyakhanya (We are lighting up)

**NEMISA Sonke Discothon 2025 Submission**

**Challenge:** Electricity Crisis – Addressing both grid instability risk and power accessibility for low-income communities.

-----

## 💡 Overview & Innovation

**Siyakhanya** is a single website offering **two specialized feasibility tools** to solve the energy crisis for distinct South African markets. Our core innovation is using advanced data modeling to transform national instability (Eskom risk) into personalized, actionable financial insights.

### Core Tools

| Tool Name | Target Market | Core Output Metric | Why it's Innovative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Investment Tool** | **Mid-Income Homes & SMMEs** | **Risk-Adjusted Payback Period (RAP)** | Quantifies **Eskom risk** using **raw historical data** to provide the true financial ROI for solar investment. |
| **The Community Tool** | **Developers & NGOs** | **Community Safety & Viability Score (CSVS)** | Models the maximum **affordable tariff** for a micro-grid, ensuring the solution is both safe and fair for low-income residents. |

## 📊 Best Use of Data & Logic

We use advanced modeling to overcome data scarcity and provide predictive insights, demonstrating the work of a **Data Analyst**.

### 1\. The Raw Data Advantage

  * **Grid Risk Data:** We use **raw Historical UCLF data** (Unplanned Capability Loss Factor) to quantify the national grid's historical instability. This data directly feeds the **RAP** calculation.
  * **Affordability Data:** We use **NERSA tariff structure** and community income data to define the **Affordability Ceiling** for the Community Tool.

### 2\. The ML Logic

  * **Advanced Calculation:** The tool uses simple **Machine Learning (ML) logic** (Time-Series Weighting) to predict the **hourly demand profile** for both markets, which is crucial for correctly sizing the battery and solar system.

## 💻 Technical Execution & UI/UX

This project is a high-quality, efficient **Software Developer** solution.

  * **Technology:** Pure **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript** (for maximum stability and speed).
  * **Visualization:** Uses the **Chart.js** library to render dynamic graphs of the **Predicted Load Profile** and the **RAP** bar chart, transforming raw data into clear insights.
  * **User Flow:** A single landing page with two clear buttons to access the respective tools, ensuring a clean and intuitive user experience.

-----

## 📈 Business Model & Media Campaign

This solution demonstrates clear market understanding and a strong **Media Strategist** approach.

### A. Business Presentation

  * **Dual Monetization:**
    1.  **Mid-Income:** **SaaS Licensing**—selling the advanced **RAP logic** to solar installers and financial institutions as a high-value lead-generation tool.
    2.  **Community:** **Subscription/Consultation**—selling the **CSVS report** to Municipalities and Mini-Grid Developers to reduce initial planning risk.

### B. Media Campaign (Slogan & Vibe)

  * **Slogan:** **"Gatvol of Guessing? Siyakhanya\! We are lighting up the future."**
  * **Strategy:** Two tailored campaigns: one focusing on **financial ROI** (Mid-Income) and one focusing on **safety and social viability** (Community), proving the solution is marketable across South Africa's diverse population.
